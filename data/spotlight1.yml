content: |
  I am a PhD student at the University of Antwerp, where I am currently researching spatial reconstruction in atom probe tomography.
  At the University of GÃ¶ttingen, I have worked on several projects in the field of computer graphics during my Bachelors and Masters. I have specialized in scientific computing and signal processing.
  I worked as the developer of CoolingGen at the German Aerospace Center.
  CoolingGen software uses common computer graphics methods such as surface-surface intersection and ray-marching on NURBS objects.
  I am qualified in Fourier analysis in the scope of Digital Signal Processing and its applications, to which I count filtering, spectrography, tomography,
  image reconstruction and compression and many more.
