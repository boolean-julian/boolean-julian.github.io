title : "About Me"
content: |
  I have specialized in scientific computing and signal processing.
  During my academic career, I have worked on several projects in the field of computer graphics.
  I currently work at the German Aerospace Center, where I develop CoolingGen, a parametric CAD modelling tool for turbine blade and vane cooling geometries.
  The software uses common computer graphics methods such as surface-surface intersection and ray-marching on NURBS objects.
  I am qualified in Fourier analysis in the scope of Digital Signal Processing and its applications, to which I count filtering, spectrography, tomography,
  image reconstruction and compression and many more.
