Hello, world! :wave:

I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Antwerp, where I develop numerical methods for atom probe tomography. This lets us see the atom-by-atom composition of a sample in 3D! :microscope: For my efforts thus far I was awarded a Student Scholar Award at the Microscopy and Microanalysis Conference 2024. :trophy:

Before my PhD I worked at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), where I developed geometric methods for the design of turbine blade cooling structures. :airplane: My dissertation was a cooperation between the Institute of Propulsion Technology at the DLR and the Institute of Numerical and Applied Mathematics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen. :student:
